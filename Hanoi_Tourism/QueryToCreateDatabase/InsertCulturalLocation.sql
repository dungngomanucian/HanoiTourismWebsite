N'Chua Lang, also known as Chieu Thien Tu, is a temple located in Lang Village, Lang Thuong Ward, Dong Da District, Hanoi. The name of the temple carries the meaning: "Because there is something clearly good, it is called Chieu (clear). This is the birthplace of the Zen master, so it is called Thien (Zen)." The temple is traditionally believed to have been constructed during the reign of King Ly Anh Tong (reigning from 1138 to 1175). The temple venerates the Zen master Tu Dao Hanh. According to legend, Tu Dao Hanh was reincarnated as the son of a nobleman named Sung Hien hau, who was the younger brother of King Ly Nhan Tong. Since King Ly Nhan Tong (reigning from 1072 to 1127) did not have a son, Sung Hien hau''s son inherited the throne, becoming King Ly Than Tong (reigning from 1128 to 1138). It was because of this legend that Ly Than Tong''s son, King Ly Anh Tong, ordered the construction of Chieu Thien Temple to honor his father and the ancestors, particularly the Zen master Tu Dao Hanh. The temple has undergone numerous renovations, with the most significant ones occurring in 1656, 1901, and 1989. The temple festival is held on the seventh day of the third lunar month, which is the birthday of Zen master Tu Dao Hanh. During the festival, the palanquin of Tu Dao Hanh is carried to Hoa Lang Temple in Dich Vong Commune, where his parents are honored. Chua Lang follows the "Forefather Buddha, Back Saint" style of temple, which is a distinctive feature. Another unique aspect of the temple is that Tu Dao Hanh is both a master and a saint of the village, so the people here offer wine and meat to him during the festival.',

N'The road leading to the Bac Qua Market is situated behind Dong Xuan Market, a renowned and ancient market in Hanoi. The Bac Qua Market has a fascinating history that not everyone is aware of. Originally established in the 1960s, it started as a makeshift market on vacant land where farmers from the northern bank of the Red River came to sell fruits and vegetables. Over time, it became a bustling hub. The name "Bac Qua" has two components, with "Bac" indicating the location on the northern bank of the Red River and "Qua" referring to the transportation of goods from the northern to the southern bank of the river.
As Bac Qua Market is closely connected to Dong Xuan Market, locals often collectively refer to both markets as Dong Xuan - Bac Qua Market. Nowadays, Bac Qua Market primarily operates on two streets: Nguyen Thien Thuat, bordered by the rear of Dong Xuan Market, and Cao Thang Street. These streets are known for selling distinctive products that contribute to the identity of Bac Qua Market.

By 1889, after the Thay Cuc Lake and To Lich River were filled, the French authorities cleared, planned, and relocated all businesses to an empty area in Dong Xuan Ward.
In 1890, the French built the market on a total area of 6,500 square meters, featuring French architecture with five triangular sections resembling beehives, five bridges, and five arched doors. Around 1990, the market was renovated, eliminating two rows on each side, leaving only the three central rows and building it into a three-story structure.
In 1995, Dong Xuan Market was rebuilt with a complete system of emergency exits, fire escapes, and ventilation. At that time, the market area reached 14,000 square meters with about 2,000 stalls, becoming the largest and most modern market in Hanoi. In 2005, the relief sculpture named "Hanoi Winter 1946" was erected next to the market to commemorate the compatriots and soldiers who sacrificed bravely in the battle to protect the capital.',

N'Absolutely amazing show. The music and puppets were entertaining and well done. They definitely sell out most shows so I suggest getting tickets online ahead of time (only a few dollars more expensive). They start exactly on time so be there a few minutes early. Get the VIP tickets so you get the front few rows. Great representation of Vietnamese culture and arts.'),

N'The park boasts lush greenery, creating a refreshing space suitable for families to enjoy even on hot sunny days. There are plenty of benches and shelters placed close together for resting. The animal enclosures are well-arranged, maintaining a clean and fresh atmosphere. There are entertainment services and light snacks available for children, such as swings, mini trains, electric cars, and more.

The zoo has multiple entrances for easy access, and there are signage boards within the premises for easy navigation to various areas of interest. It''s recommended to bring hats or caps for a better experience. The scenic landscape features a cool surrounding pond and colorful underwater ball games.

N'Regarding the product, there hasn''t been much innovation compared to previous years, and the infrastructure is lacking. There are too few restroom facilities for such a large park, and the existing restrooms are not adequately maintained for cleanliness. If left unchanged, this could negatively impact the image of Vietnam when receiving international visitors. It may be beneficial to learn from the Vinsafari Phu Quoc model and consider implementing higher service fees in exchange for improved facilities and services.'),

N'As a famous wholesale and retail hub in Hanoi, the area around the market sparkles at night with a myriad of stalls, offering a wide range of goods at prices catering to both locals and tourists.')
