N'Goods are not much expensive than downtown. Place is neat, modern, well maintained. Service staff are polite and professional. People who works in the offices are well appearance too. By the way, surprisi6, I noticed quite a number of groceries items at the supermarket at B1 is much cheaper than VIMCOM Centre Supermark. Nice luxury shopping mall. We were interested in the Lotte Mart, a good supermarket with limited foreign offerings. Should you have any type of bag, they will tie-wrap it before entering the supermarket.
Price wise it compares with chains like Vinmart. We wanted to grab a bite before heading out to the park, but NO real food court. On the 6 FL the gourmet promenade is a selection of fine dining restos.'),

N'Great place to go at night where things come alive around the square. I recommend dining at any of the restaurants located around the square to get a good view of the square.')
