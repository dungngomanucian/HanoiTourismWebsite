N'Phao Dai Lang was the site where the first series of artillery shells were fired, marking the signal for Hanoi to initiate the Nationwide Resistance War, following the orders of the High Command. The Vietnamese artillery, newly established at that time, was tasked with attacking the enemy forces right in the heart of the city. Phao Dai Lang back then was situated on the fields of Lang Trung Village, now known as Phao Dai Lang Street, stretching from the intersection of Huynh Thuc Khang - Nguyen Chi Thanh Streets to Lang Street, Dong Da District, Hanoi. The area of the fortress has been developed into the historical site of Phao Dai Lang (located within the headquarters of the Vietnam General Department of Meteorology). After 60 days and nights, Phao Dai Lang, together with the people of Hanoi, excellently fulfilled the mission of "Holding enemy troops in Hanoi, depleting the enemy''s resources, and preserving our forces to create conditions for our people to prepare for long-term resistance..." The Capital Regiment was ordered to withdraw from the city. The historical site of Phao Dai Lang was designated as a national historical relic in 1993. Within the area, there is still displayed a 75mm artillery gun and a traditional room showcasing numerous paintings, photographs, and artifacts from the early days of the resistance war against the French. This will be an educational site for the younger generation, teaching them about the courage and pride of our ancestors who fought in the first days when Hanoi, along with the entire nation, began the resistance war.',

N'The Voi Phuc Temple, formerly known as the Western Guardian Temple of ancient Thang Long, is a historic and cultural landmark situated in the heart of the present-day capital city. With a history spanning over 1000 years, the temple is steeped in historical significance and mysterious legends. During your journey to explore Hanoi, visitors should not miss the opportunity to visit this temple to discover its history and partake in ceremonial rituals. The Voi Phuc Temple, also referred to as the Thuy Le Voi Phuc Temple to distinguish it from another temple of the same name located in Thuy Khue, Hanoi, is one of the four guardian temples of ancient Thang Long. These four temples were dedicated to the guardians of the East, West, South, and North of the imperial citadel of Thang Long, with the Voi Phuc Temple guarding the western flank.  Legend has it that the Voi Phuc Temple is associated with Prince Linh Lang, who played a significant role in resisting the invasion of the Song Dynasty. After his death in battle at the Cau River in 1076, the local people in Thuy Le erected a temple to honor him, and the king bestowed upon Linh Lang the title of "Great Prince Supreme Deity." The name "Voi Phuc" originates from the two kneeling elephants positioned in front of the temple, while the designation "Western Guardian" or "Doai Guardian" reflects its location to the west of the citadel. The temple, dedicated to Prince Linh Lang, son of King Ly Thanh Tong and Duong Thi Quang, was traditionally believed to have been constructed in the seventh year of Chương Thánh Gia Khánh (1065) during the reign of King Ly Thanh Tong. It is situated on a high mound in the Thuy Le area. Over the years, the Voi Phuc Temple has undergone numerous renovations, including significant refurbishments in 1994, 2000, and a comprehensive restoration in 2009 in preparation for the 1000th anniversary celebration of Thang Long - Hanoi. Participating in the festival at the Voi Phuc Temple offers a unique spiritual and cultural experience for both locals and visitors alike. The festival takes place over three days, typically on the 9th, 10th, and 11th days of the second lunar month each year. Visitors have the opportunity to witness religious ceremonies and traditional rituals commemorating Prince Linh Lang. Additionally, festival-goers can participate in various activities and enjoy entertainment, with highlights including processions, incense offerings, ceremonial offerings, cockfighting, martial arts performances, and more.',

N'Kim Ma Temple, located at 61 Kim Ma Street, Kim Ma Ward, Ba Dinh District, Hanoi (opposite the Ward People''s Committee), dates back to at least the late 18th century and is dedicated to worshipping three deities: Bo Cai Dai Vuong, Linh Lang Dai Vuong, and mandarin Hoang Phuc Trung. The temple is named after the ancient village of Kim Ma, one of the Thap Tam Trai (13 villages) traditionally established from the 11th century west of the Thang Long citadel. During the Ly – Tran dynasties, the land of Kim Ma village was used as a place to raise horses for the Royal Court, hence also known as Tau Ma or Ma Trại. Some historical documents record that Kim Ma Temple was built long ago, as evidenced by inscriptions on stone steles renovated during the reigns of Tu Duc in 1875 and Khai Dinh in 1925. The temple was destroyed by the French colonialists, and its roof was used to construct the headquarters of the Ward People''s Committee before being returned to the community for reconstruction. Over time, due to urbanization, the temple grounds have shrunk significantly, leaving space only for a paved courtyard, a communal house, and the main hall. The large courtyard in front of the main gate is now used for volleyball, badminton, and table tennis. Surrounding land has been developed into high-rise buildings, and the ancient trees on both sides have disappeared, while the view towards the temple''s south side has been obstructed. Kim Ma Temple still preserves a royal seal of Phung Hung, a rare kneeling-style ancestral altar, and four stone steles recounting its renovations. Of particular note is the inscription "Trung tu noi dinh bi ki" by Confucian scholar Le Dinh Dien from Cuc Hien, erected in 1875, documenting the legend of Phung Hung and Kim Ma village. This historical document has been translated and published in the book "History of Hanoi''s Inscriptions". The temple worships three important figures: Bo Cai Dai Vuong, Linh Lang Dai Vuong, and mandarin Hoang Phuc Trung, all associated with significant historical events in the region. Recognized as a National Architectural Artistic Monument by the Ministry of Culture and Information on December 27, 1990, Kim Ma Temple is located about 500 meters east of the temple, where Kim Son Pagoda and Phung Hung''s Tomb, both classified as National Historical Sites, can also be found.',

N'Ngoc Khanh Temple dates back to the 18th century and worships three deities: Linh Lang, Hoang Phuc Trung, and Ba chua Kho. During the French colonial period, Ngoc Khanh commune had its own village chief and deputy chief, with a population of over 200 residents in 1928. The village had no religious institutions; Buddhist followers often went to Kim Son Pagoda, while a few Christians used to attend Lieu Giai Church [now La Thanh Hotel]. Ngoc Khanh commune was dotted with numerous ponds, some of which were filled in during the late 20th century when Phuc Thien Cemetery was relocated. In 1983, during the renovation of Ngoc Khanh Lake, relics believed to be part of the Giang Vo Palace foundation and a collection of ancient iron weapons from the Tran Dynasty were discovered (now preserved at the Hanoi Museum). This area later became Cau Giay Ward and was renamed Ngoc Khanh Ward on November 22, 1996. The temple has existed since the 18th century, dedicated to the worship of three high-ranking deities. First is Hoang Phuc Trung, a royal court official during the Ly Dynasty, who established the "Thap tam trai" and is primarily worshipped at Le Mat Temple. Second is Linh Lang Dai Vuong, the founding prince of the Ly Dynasty, worshipped at Voi Phuc Temple (Thu Le). Third is Ly Chau Nuong, also known as Ba Chua Kho, a female general during the Tran Dynasty, worshipped at Giang Vo Temple.The entrance gate features four pillars, with Han-script couplets, and decorative bas-reliefs on either side. The temple faces southeast towards Ngoc Khanh Lake, with an ancient banyan tree on the left. The temple grounds are relatively small due to reduced space. Behind the brick courtyard is a two-story, eight-roofed communal house. Adjacent to it is the main worship hall and rear chamber, both with three sections and a "double-N" shape. The rear chamber has stacked eaves, making it taller. The temple currently preserves four ancient imperial edicts, with the earliest dating back to the Minh Menh reign (1821). There are also various ceremonial objects and decorations such as bells, drums, censers, bronze tripods, incense burners, and horizontal lacquered boards. The majority of these items date back to the 19th and 20th centuries. The annual temple festival is held on the 23rd day of the third lunar month. In 2006, Ngoc Khanh Temple was recognized as a national architectural and artistic relic by the Hanoi People''s Committee.',

N'Bốt Hàng Đậu, initially known as Đài Đầu, and also recognized by various names such as Hàng Đậu Water Tower and Round Water Factory, is a captivating destination in Hanoi that beckons visitors to explore and experience its classical charm.
Constructed in 1894 alongside Đồn Thủy Water Tower, Bốt Hàng Đậu played a crucial role in supplying water to the city during the French colonial era. At that time, it efficiently distributed water to the neighborhoods between the capital, controlled through large regulating valves. In areas with a significant French population, the valves remained open, while water supply to Vietnamese neighborhoods was often restricted.
Situated at the intersection of the old quarters Hàng Than, Hàng Lược, Hàng Giấy, Hàng Đậu, Quán Thánh, and Phan Đình Phùng, the 25-meter-high water tower is likened to the "Roman Colosseum," boasting classical and refined European architectural elements.
Throughout its existence, Bốt Hàng Đậu has witnessed numerous historical events. It observed the arrival of liberation troops crossing Long Bien Bridge and bid farewell to the last soldier departing for Marseille from Hải Phòng. Despite enduring the brutality of war, facing bombs and bloodshed, the water tower has stood resilient, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Vietnamese people.
Currently, the water tower no longer serves its original purpose of supplying water to the public. Instead, it has been transformed into an art exhibition space. Notably, the art installations within the water tower are crafted from recycled materials. The sound of falling water is recorded and played directly, combined with lighting effects to enhance the expansive atmosphere inside the tower. Unlike the bustling noise outside the six-way intersection, visitors find themselves immersed in a tranquil, enchanting space within the water tower, with wooden pathways, touches of green and red, and the soothing sound of water. Admission to the exhibition is free, but to ensure a complete experience, visitors are guided in groups of 20-30 people during their exploration.',

The bronze relief, weighing 7 tons and standing 5.7 meters tall, is placed on a high pedestal, portraying the courage and determination of our troops and people in the early days of the resistance. The monument is a tourist attraction for both domestic and international visitors, serving as a place for future generations to remember the heroic martyrs who sacrificed for the independence and freedom of the Fatherland.',

N'When mentioning the symbols of the capital Hanoi, one cannot overlook Dong Xuan Market – one of the largest markets in the North, with a history of hundreds of years. Not only a bustling trading place, it is also known as the "culinary paradise in the heart of Hanoi," where you can enjoy all the delicious specialties of the Hanoians.
Dong Xuan Market is located in the Old Quarter of Hanoi, in Dong Xuan Ward, Hoan Kiem District. The market is only about 800 meters away from Hoan Kiem Lake, quite close to Hang Ma Street and Long Bien Station. To the east of the market is Dong Xuan Alley, to the west is Dong Xuan Street, to the north is Hang Khoai Street, and to the south is Cau Dong Street.
Right behind the market is Bac Qua Market – a market that has been around since the 1960s. People often refer to it as Dong Xuan – Bac Qua Market. Compared to the surrounding areas, Dong Xuan is still a relatively young market. However, it is one of the largest wholesale markets in Hanoi, mainly serving for distribution and wholesale. Besides, the market also has retail stalls with quite affordable prices. It is considered a must-visit shopping destination when traveling to Hanoi.
Like many other markets in the city, Dong Xuan Market opens every day of the week, from 6 AM to 6 PM. The food area in the market alley operates until early morning. Especially on the last three days of the week, the market will be open until 10:30 PM to serve the shopping and strolling needs of tourists.
Dong Xuan Market is also known as "Big Market," a large-scale market that has existed for hundreds of years. According to records, in 1804, the Nguyen dynasty built a market in the south of the To Lich River for the convenience of boat trading. By 1889, after the Thay Cuc Lake and To Lich River were filled, the French authorities cleared, planned, and relocated all businesses to an empty area in Dong Xuan Ward.
In 1890, the French built the market on a total area of 6,500 square meters, featuring French architecture with five triangular sections resembling beehives, five bridges, and five arched doors. Around 1990, the market was renovated, eliminating two rows on each side, leaving only the three central rows and building it into a three-story structure.
In 1995, Dong Xuan Market was rebuilt with a complete system of emergency exits, fire escapes, and ventilation. At that time, the market area reached 14,000 square meters with about 2,000 stalls, becoming the largest and most modern market in Hanoi. In 2005, the relief sculpture named "Hanoi Winter 1946" was erected next to the market to commemorate the compatriots and soldiers who sacrificed bravely in the battle to protect the capital.',

N'O Quan Chuong is the only remaining gate of Hanoi, bearing a bold historical imprint of the imperial citadel of Thang Long. Through the ups and downs of history and the changes in weather, the gate has undergone numerous renovations. Consequently, moss layers and ancient features have somewhat decayed.
According to historical records, Thang Long Imperial Citadel had five gates: Cau Giay Gate, Cho Dua Gate, Cau Den Gate, Dong Mac Gate, and O Quan Chuong Gate. Each gate was built like a fortress, open during the day and closed at night, fortified with guards to prevent intrusions and guard against fires.
O Quan Chuong, also known as Dong Ha Gate (gate of Dong Ha ward), was constructed in the 10th year of Canh Hung reign (1749) under the rule of the Le dynasty. In the 46th year of Canh Hung reign (1785), this gate underwent major renovations. By the 3rd year of Gia Long reign (1804), the gate was rebuilt and expanded to its current scale. O Quan Chuong is situated to the east of the land fortress surrounding Thang Long Imperial Citadel.
O Quan Chuong consists of two floors, built in the style of a watchtower - a characteristic architectural style of the Nguyen dynasty. The first floor has three doors, with the main door in the middle, approximately 3 meters high and wide, and two side doors on either side, about 1.65 meters wide and 2.5 meters high. What sets them apart is that all three doors are designed in a curved vault style. The second floor has a four-sided roofed watchtower, slightly smaller at the position above the main door, with decorative railings adorned with hexagons, quadrilaterals, and floral motifs. Between the top of the main door and the watchtower is a rectangular frame, nearly 1 meter high and about 3 meters wide, bearing the relief of three Han characters "Dong Ha Mon". On the left wall of the main door, there is a stone tablet commissioned by Governor Hoang Dieu in 1881, inscribed with the order prohibiting guards from disturbing the people passing through the gate. The moss and erosion of time have made O Quan Chuong become ancient, attracting many domestic and foreign tourists to visit.
According to historical records, Dong Ha Mon was renamed O Quan Chuong to commemorate the contributions of a Chuong officer and a battalion of 100 soldiers under his command, who bravely fought against the French army to defend Hanoi. For the native Hanoians or those who have lived for a long time on streets like O Quan Chuong, Hang Chieu, Tran Nhat Duat, etc., O Quan Chuong has become intimate and inseparable.',

N'The Voi Phuc Temple is a place of worship dedicated to Prince Linh Lang Dai Vuong – the deity who helped the king maintain peace and prosperity in the western part of the Imperial Citadel. The temple is considered one of the most sacred places in the capital city with a thousand years of history. Linh Lang was the fourth prince of King Ly Thanh Tong. His mother, Cao Nuong, was from Bong Lai village, Dan Phuong district, Ha Tay province, and her family moved to Thi Trại (Market Camp) to live. She was a beautiful young woman, surpassing others in beauty. King Ly Thanh Tong met her and fell in love, offering 100 taels of gold as a betrothal gift and bringing her back to the palace as a concubine. During my visit to the historical site of Voi Phuc Temple on January 26, 2024, I was deeply impressed by the fresh and cool atmosphere here. It''s an ideal place for a leisurely stroll and admiring the beautiful scenery. Furthermore, this historical site provides a wonderful opportunity to explore and learn about its unique history.'),

N'The art and creativity festival was quite crowded. We waited in line for about half an hour, but the show went by so quickly. Only 5 minutes! 
The floor space was around 70 square meters, a bit small, making it a bit difficult to move around in two rows, so we couldn''t fully enjoy the exhibits.
There was background music, amplified by microphones and speakers.
If there was a faint scent of some fragrant herbs like jasmine, grapefruit flowers, or maybe scented candles, it would have left a more lasting impression.'),

N'The railway track, over a hundred years old, running through the heart of Hanoi''s Old Quarter, has recently become an attractive tourist spot, especially for foreigners. Sitting at roadside eateries, watching the trains pass by, and observing the local life, though potentially dangerous, still piques the curiosity of many tourists who want to experience it.'),

N'It''s a very nice lake right in the center of Hanoi Old Quarter. Clean and peaceful too! We''ve seen lots of elderly locals doing aerobic in early morning. Wow, it''s interesting! They looked so happy while doing aerobic and dancing together. We didn''t think that people can do aerobic outside and close to nature like that.')
